# Pew-Pew
This is a repository for a project submitted to the Pygame Community Summer Jam 2024.

Additionally this is a virtual environment, so you might need to activate it through `scripts\activate.bat` to use it.
I plan to remove the virtual environment aspect of this project so that it is more usable.

## Usage

### a) Install necessary dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### b) Execute main file

```sh
python main.py
```
