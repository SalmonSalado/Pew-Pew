This is a repository for a project submitted to the Pygame Community Summer Jam 2024.

Additionally this is a virtual environment, so you might need to activate it through `scripts\activate.bat` to use it.
I plan to remove the virtual environment aspect of this project so that it is more usable.

## Usage

### a) Install necessary dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### b) Execute main file

```sh
python main.py
```

### c) Enjoy

That's it. I hope you enjoy trying this little project that I made. It is the firt game-project that I complete in my own, incorporating techniques and methods from tutorials and other sources, but adapting them into my own needs and what the project needed. It felt satisfying working on this, even though it is very simple and not properly optimized.
